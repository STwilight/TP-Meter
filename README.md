The aim of this project is creation of compact device, based on ATMega8 microcontroller, which manage  two load  channels  with  connected heaters via relay block, using  monitoring  data (temperature of heaters, received from DS18B20 sensors and overall power consumption, received from non-invasive current sensor SCT-013-030).
